                            our sight. However it is more comfortable for us to read in good light conditions not to struggle to see every letter. Enjoying books in dim light can only shorten the time when eye strain effect appears. </p>

                        <p><img class="col-md-6 eyesImg" src="../LIBRARY/IMG/imgSight/smartphoneNight.jpg" alt="eyes">It is due to the blue light emitted by screens of smartphones, tablets and ohter devices. Artifical blue light tricks our brains into waking
                            up and disturbs the natural body's rhythm of sleeping. It can lead to insomnia.

                        <p><img class="col-md-6 eyesImg" src="../LIBRARY/IMG/imgSight/blackWhiteContrast.jpg" alt="eyes">If it comes to digital displays it might seems confisuing whether it is better to read white letters on black background or vice versla.
                            Most studies have shown that it is better to read black text on white background. When the background is white it is bright and it forces iris to close a bit more comparing to dark background. It prevents from "Halation" effect.
                            It is also a good idea to turn the white background into light-grey so the black text is easier to read than in a white background because less light is reflected behind the text. In addition eyes will not be tired so quickly.

                            can help reduce the stress in the muscles that hold Your eyes. 1. Close Your eyes and put palms on eyelids. Apply light pressure on Your eyes - it will spread the tear film evenly in Your eyes and relax them. 2. Keep Your head
                            motionless and move Your eyes from left to right and from down to top. Reapeat that five times. 3. Try to draw a figure eight with Your eyes.

                            being dry out and strained Your eyes can tear up. It can be caused by too long time spent in front of a screen without proper breaks. Furthermore broken blood vessels appear as long as Your eyes are overworked.

                            eyes are strained to focus vision on the nearby object. If the thing You're looking at is always in the same distance the same muscles are strained. Imagine Your shopping routine when You have all heavy items in one bag. From
                            time to time You have to change hand that carries the bag. The same is with the muscles supporting the eye. You need to change the objects, according to distance, you are looking at to avoid eye's muscles fatigue. It is also
                            a good habbit to consciously do some exercises to relax Your eyes.
